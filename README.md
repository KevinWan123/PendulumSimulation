# Introduction
<p>Hello! My name is Kevin and this is my Double Pendulum Project. While doing this project, I have learned so much about physics, gui building, and programming in general. I wanted to capture the motion of a double pendulum and have the values of it be constantly adjustable.</p>

<p> To start this project, I mathematically calculated the trajectory of a double pendulum using my knowledge of dynamics which my professor has bestowed upon me.</p>
Here is an image of a double pendulum.

# How I solved the Double Pendulum

First, I need obtain the x and y values of each pendulum. To do this I used trigonomtry to find all the lengths.
$x_1= l_1sin(\theta_1)$ , $x_2= l_2sin(\theta_2)$, $y_1= l_2cos(\theta_2)$ , $y_2= l_2sin(\theta_2)$
