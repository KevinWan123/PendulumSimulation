# Introduction
<p>Hello! My name is Kevin and this is my Double Pendulum Project. While doing this project, I have learned so much about physics, gui building, and programming in general. I wanted to capture the motion of a double pendulum and have the values of it be constantly adjustable.</p>

<p> To start this project, I mathematically calculated the trajectory of a double pendulum using dynamics.</p>
